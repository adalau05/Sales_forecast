Sales forecast:
Load sales data from 2023 to 2025. Then, develop a SARIMAX model to forecast sales for the year 2026. Visualize both historical and predicted sales data, and finally, summarize the predicted sales for 2026 along with any insights derived from the analysis.

SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) models are a popular choice for time series forecasting. They can capture both the trend and seasonality in your data, making them versatile for various applications.
